General Notes:

   * Framework for testing Apache httpd
   * Modular/extendable, etc.
   * Ability to test all Apache functionality we use at Ariba, including:
      * Rewrite rules
      * mod_jk/WO/mod_proxy_balancer "workers" represented by ariba::Test::Apache::MockServer objects
      * Proxying
      * SSL??
      * Caching??
      * Logging??
      * Deflate??
      * Uploads?? (LimitRequestBody)
      * Specific ErrorDocument handling?? (400, 404, 413)
      * Busy page??
      * Access Control??


ariba::Test::Apache
   * Base class for running tests, proxies to the ariba::Test::Apache::TestServer and ariba::Test::Apache::MockServer(s) it controlls
